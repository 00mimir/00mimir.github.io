Desde que comprei o livro O Hobbit Anotado, antes mesmo de ler (mal comecei a ler o livro enquanto estou escrevendo esse documento), eu fiquei fascinado com a ideia de “anotar um livro”. Eu fiquei me perguntando como seria o processo; qual formato deveria utilizar; o que eu poderia colocar. 

Nos últimos anos eu desenvolvi uma grande paixão por A Song of Ice and Fire, que começou com a série Game of Thrones e foi transferida para os livros. Desde então eu passo horas dos meus dias escutando podcasts, pensando na história e esperando o The Winds of Winter. Tal paixão chegou a um ponto que decidi que quero estudar os livros, outros trabalhos do autor e os trabalhos que influenciaram ele essa história que tanto passo tempo pensando. Estudar os livros da saga em si já representa um grande desafio, e estudar esse “material complementar” deixa a tarefa maior ainda.

A ideia aqui é explorar um hobby, através do esforço criativo de tentar identificar aspectos e temas que eu gosto e que considero importante para algo que tenho chamado de “mitologia martiniana” e que possa estar sendo aplicado em ASOIAF, e compilar isso em documentos para que eu possa consultar. 

Em algum momento eu pretendo publicar isso em um blog para que outras pessoas possam tirar as suas próprias conclusões e bolar as suas próprias teorias. 

O conjunto de textos a seguir são a minha tentativa de “anotar” Fevre Dream, tentando começar com um livro menor para que eu possa ir expandindo com A Song of Ice and Fire posteriormente. 

Espero que quem esteja lendo, goste, inclusive (e talvez principalmente) eu mesmo.

## St. Louis, April 1857

O capítulo começa com Abner Marsh chegando ao hotel Planters’ House para uma reunião de negócios com Joshua York. 

O balconista do hotel (clerk) o reconhece e comenta sobre o acidente em que Marsh esteve envolvido no último inverno. Abner fica incomodado com o comentário, desconversa e pede para o balconista indicar o quarto de York. O atendente informa que Joshua não está em seu quarto, e sim no salão de jantar, o que causa certa estranhamento em Marsh, visto que são 12:10 AM, horário que ele confirma tanto no relógio do hotel quanto no seu de bolso. O balconista responde dizendo que Joshua faz os seus próprios horários, e que ele não é do tipo de pessoa que se recusa algo.  

Em seguida Marsh vai em direção ao salão de jantar e chega a mesa de York. A descrição desse primeiro encontro é muito interessante, principalmente quando Abner olha pela primeira vez nos olhos de Joshua:

> Till the rest of his days were done, Abner Marsh remembered that moment, that first look into the eyes of Joshua York. Whatever thoughts he had had, whatever plans he had made, were sucked up in the maelstrom of York’s eyes. Boy and old man and dandy and foreigner, all those were gone in an instant, and there was only York, the man himself, the power of him, the dream, the intensity.
> 
> York’s eyes were gray, startlingly dark in such a pale face. His pupils were pinpoints, burning black, and they reached right into Marsh and weighed the soul inside him. The gray around them seemed alive, moving, like fog on the river on a dark night, when the banks vanish and the lights vanish and there is nothing in the world but your boat and the river and the fog. In those mists, Abner Marsh saw things; visions swift-glimpsed and then gone. There was a cool intelligence peering out of those mists. But there was a beast as well, dark and frightening, chained and angry, raging at the fog. Laughter and loneliness and cruel passion; York had all of that in his eyes.
> 
> But mostly there was force in those eyes, terrible force, a strength as relentless and merciless as the ice that had crushed Marsh’s dreams. Somewhere in that fog, Marsh could sense the ice moving, slow, so slow, and he could hear the awful splintering of his boats and all his hopes.

Essas passagens falam muito sobre Joshua York que chega a ser impressionante a quantidade de informações que o George nos oferece tão cedo no livro. 

George faz proveito da ideia de os olhos serem a janela da alma e nos transmite tudo o que Joshua é: forte, intenso, inteligente, um sonhador que dentro de si tem alegria, solidão e uma paixão cruel, e no meio de tudo isso, no meio da neblina que o cinza dos seus olhos representam, há uma besta aprisionada e com raiva. 

Joshua York é o primeiro vampiro que conhecemos na história. Cada detalhe que George nos deu, desde o balconista nos falar que ele faz os seus próprios horários e que é do tipo de pessoa que não se diz não, até essa troca de olhares em entre ele e Marsh, vai ser construído junto com a narrativa e vão ocupar o centro de toda a trama.

%% Joshua fala que está tomando Burgundy no jantar. Não sei se ele fala a mesma coisa no barco. Com certeza é a poção.  %%

## Personagens

#### Abner Marsh

Abner Marsh é um dos nossos protagonistas. Um barqueiro com bastante experiência que sofreu um acidente [não sei a quanto tempo], mas que depois faz um acordo com Joshua York para construir um barco a vapor, que depois será batizado de Fevre Dream.

Falar sobre as características físicas.

Abner Marsh é descrito como um homem grande, tanto de altura quanto de largura, feio e acima do peso, com cabelos ruivos, que anda com uma bengala, mesmo sem a necessidade de uma. É um homem orgulhoso, corajoso, fiel aos seus companheiros e que tenta honrar seus acordos. 

Marsh was a massive man, six foot tall and three hundred pounds heavy. He had a red face and a full black beard that he wore to cover up a flat, pushed-in nose and a faceful of warts, but even the whiskers didn’t help much; they called him the ugliest man on the river, and he knew it. In his heavy blue captain’s coat with its double row of brass buttons, he was a fierce and imposing figure



#### Joshua York
Joshua Anton York

Joshua York é o primeiro vampiro que conhecemos, com olhos cinzas, pálido e cabelos brancos.

Joshua York é descrito como alto, com pele branca ao ponto de ser pálida, com olhos cinzas bem escuros e cabelos loiros pálidos, com mãos femininas (segundo Marsh), com um aspecto de menino e homem ao mesmo tempo.

“For my own reasons, I want to be master of a steamboat. I want to travel the length of this great river, in comfort and privacy, not as passenger but as captain. I have a dream, a purpose. I seek friends and allies, and I have enemies, many enemies. The details are none of your concern. If you press me about them, I will tell you lies. Do not press me.” His eyes grew hard a moment, then softened as he smiled. “Your only interest need be my desire to own and command a steamboat, Captain. As you can tell, I am no riverman. I know nothing of steamboats, or the Mississippi, beyond what I have read in a few books and learned during the weeks I have spent in St. Louis. Obviously, I need an associate, someone who is familiar with the river and river people, someone who can manage the day-to-day operations of my boat, and leave me free to pursue my own purposes.

“This associate must have other qualities as well. He must be discreet, as I do not wish to have my behavior—which I admit to be sometimes peculiar—become the talk of the levee. He must be trustworthy, since I will give all management over into his hands. He must have courage. I do not want a weakling, or a superstitious man, or one who is overly religious. Are you a religious man, Captain?”

“No,” said Marsh. “Never cared for bible-thumpers, nor them for me.”

York smiled. “Pragmatic. I want a pragmatic man. I want a man who will concentrate on his own part of the business, and not ask too many questions of me. I value my privacy, and if sometimes my actions seem strange or arbitrary or capricious, I do not want them challenged. Do you understand my requirements?”

Marsh tugged thoughtfully on his beard. “And if I do?”

Quando estava mostrando o eclipse:

“Quite well. I have excellent night vision. This is a special boat, then?”

## Barcos a vapor (steamboats)

“The Fevre River Packet Company, that’s me,” Marsh went on. “Called it that on account of where I was born, up on the Fevre near Galena, not ’cause I only worked that river, since I didn’t. I had six boats, working mostly the upper Mississippi trade, St. Louis to St. Paul, with some trips up the Fevre and the Illinois and the Missouri. I was doing just fine, adding a new boat or two most every year, thinking of moving into the Ohio trade, or maybe even New Orleans. But last July my _Mary Clarke_ blew a boiler and burned, up near to Dubuque, burned right to the water line with a hundred dead. And this winter—this was a terrible winter. I had four of my boats wintering here at St. Louis. The _Nicholas Perrot,_ the _Dunleith,_ the _Sweet Fevre,_ and my _Elizabeth A.,_ brand new, only four months in service and a sweet boat too, near 300 feet long with 12 big boilers, fast as any steamboat on the river. I was real proud of my lady Liz. She cost me $200,000, but she was worth every penny of it.” The soup arrived. Marsh tasted a spoonful and scowled. “Too hot,” he said. “Well, anyway, St. Louis is a good place to winter. Don’t freeze too bad down here, nor too long. This winter was different, though. Yes, sir. Ice jam. Damn river froze _hard_.” Marsh extended a huge red hand across the table, palm up, and slowly closed his fingers into a fist. “Put an egg in there and you get the idea, York. Ice can crush a steamboat easier than I can crush an egg. When it breaks up it’s even worse, big gorges sliding down the river, smashing up wharfs, levees, boats, most everything. Winter’s end, I’d lost my boats, all four of ’em. The ice took ’em away from me.”

“Insurance?” York asked.

Marsh set to his soup, sucking it up noisily. In between spoons, he shook his head. “I’m not a gambling man, Mister York. I never took no stock in insurance. It’s gambling, all it is, ’cept you’re bettin’ against yourself. What money I made, I put into my boats.”

York nodded. “I believe you still own one steamboat.”

“That I do,” Marsh said. He finished his soup and signaled for the next course. “The _Eli Reynolds,_ a little 150-ton stern-wheeler. I been using her on the Illinois, ’cause she don’t draw much, and she wintered in Peoria, missed the worse of the ice. That’s my asset, sir, that’s what I got left. Trouble is, Mister York, the _Eli Reynolds_ ain’t worth much. She only cost me $25,000 new, and that was back in ’50.”

“Seven years,” York said. “Not a very long time.”

Marsh shook his head. “Seven years is a powerful long time for a steamboat,” he said. “Most of ’em don’t last but four or five. River just eats ’em up. The _Eli Reynolds_ was better built than most, but still, she ain’t got that long left.”

#### Eclipse 

“Hell yes, she’s special. She’s the _Eclipse_. Every goddamned man and boy on this river knows her. Old now—she was built back in ’52, five years ago. But she’s still grand. Cost $375,000, so they say, and worth all of it. There ain’t never been a bigger, fancier, more formid-a-bul boat than this one right here. I’ve studied her, taken passage on her. I know.” Marsh pointed. “She measures 365 feet by 40, and her grand saloon is 330 feet long, and you never seen nothin’ like it. Got a gold statue of Henry Clay at one end, and Andy Jackson at the other, the two of ’em glaring at each other the whole damn way. More crystal and silver and colored glass than the Planters’ House ever dreamed of, oil paintings, food like you ain’t never tasted, and mirrors—_such_ mirrors. And all that’s nothin’ to her speed.

“Down below on the main deck she carries 15 boilers. Got an 11-foot stroke, I tell you, and there ain’t a boat on any river can run with her when Cap’n Sturgeon gets up her steam. She’s done eighteen miles an hour upstream, easy. Back in ’53, she set the record from New Orleans to Louisville. I know her time by heart. Four days, nine hours, thirty minutes, and she beat the goddamned _A. L. Shotwell_ by fifty minutes, fast as the _Shotwell_ is.” Marsh rounded to face York. “I hoped my Lady Liz would take the _Eclipse_ some day, beat her time or race her head to head, but she never could of done it, I know that now. I was just foolin’ myself. I didn’t have the money it takes to build a boat that can take the _Eclipse_.

“You give me that money, Mister York, and you’ve got yourself a partner. There’s your answer, sir. You want half of Fevre River Packets, and a partner who runs things quiet and don’t ask you no questions ’bout your business? Fine. Then you give me the money to build a steamboat like that.”

## Locais

### Hotel Planters’ House

Hotel que aparenta ser um bom estabelecimento, frequentado majoritariamente por barqueiros, amigos e rivais de Marsh segundo ele mesmo. Os preços do local parecem ser relativamente altos. 

  

Esse é o primeiro local que conhecemos, porque é justamente aqui que Marsh e York se encontram pela primeira vez e começam a sua parceria.
