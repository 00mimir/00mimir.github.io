#### Abner Marsh

Abner Marsh é um dos nossos protagonistas. Um barqueiro com bastante experiência que sofreu um acidente no inverno de 1856, mas que depois fez um acordo com Joshua York para construir um barco a vapor, que eventualmente seria batizado de Fevre Dream.

Falar sobre as características físicas.

Abner Marsh é descrito como um homem grande, com aproximadamente 1,80 m de altura e pesando algo em torno de 136 kg. Com um rosto vermelho preenchido com uma barba negra que cobria um nariz achatado e um rosto cheio de verrugas. Ele era gentilmente chamado de o home mais feio do rio. Todas essas características passavam a impressão de um homem a ser temido.

Essa feiura é um contraste com o interior de Marsh: mesmo sendo um homem bruto e boca suja, ele é um bom amigo que tenta honrar a sua palavra. Marsh, apesar de viver no sul dos Estados Unidos em um período onde a escravidão ainda não tinha sido abolida e estar entranhada no tecido social e na economia da região, já havia dado a liberdade para um negro que é seu cozinheiro no Fevre Dream. 

A história se passa em um período onde a escravidão ainda não tinha sida abolida nos Estados Unidos como um todo. Alguns estados do norte aboliram a escravidão em 1805, mas os estados do sul continuaram com a prática até ser abolida 1865. Como os acontecimentos se passam no sul, existe uma espécie de resistência de Marsh de se considerar um abolicionista, mas eventualmente ele supera isso e considera a escravidão uma maldição. 
#### Joshua York

Joshua Anton York é o primeiro vampiro que conhecemos. Ele é descrito como alto, com pele branca ao ponto de ser pálida, com olhos cinzas bem escuros e cabelos loiros pálidos. Marsh ora acha que as mão dele tem um aspecto feminino, depois muda de idea. Marsh também acha que ele é meio menino e homem ao mesmo tempo.

Eu não sei muito bem o que fazer com esse trecho, mas vou salvar porque acho importante

> “For my own reasons, I want to be master of a steamboat. I want to travel the length of this great river, in comfort and privacy, not as passenger but as captain. I have a dream, a purpose. I seek friends and allies, and I have enemies, many enemies. The details are none of your concern. If you press me about them, I will tell you lies. Do not press me.” His eyes grew hard a moment, then softened as he smiled. “Your only interest need be my desire to own and command a steamboat, Captain. As you can tell, I am no riverman. I know nothing of steamboats, or the Mississippi, beyond what I have read in a few books and learned during the weeks I have spent in St. Louis. Obviously, I need an associate, someone who is familiar with the river and river people, someone who can manage the day-to-day operations of my boat, and leave me free to pursue my own purposes.
> 
> “This associate must have other qualities as well. He must be discreet, as I do not wish to have my behavior—which I admit to be sometimes peculiar—become the talk of the levee. He must be trustworthy, since I will give all management over into his hands. He must have courage. I do not want a weakling, or a superstitious man, or one who is overly religious. Are you a religious man, Captain?”
> 
> “No,” said Marsh. “Never cared for bible-thumpers, nor them for me.”
> 
> York smiled. “Pragmatic. I want a pragmatic man. I want a man who will concentrate on his own part of the business, and not ask too many questions of me. I value my privacy, and if sometimes my actions seem strange or arbitrary or capricious, I do not want them challenged. Do you understand my requirements?”
> 
> Marsh tugged thoughtfully on his beard. “And if I do?”

%% Joshua fala que está tomando Burgundy no jantar. Não sei se ele fala a mesma coisa no barco. Com certeza é a poção.  %%

Quando estava mostrando o eclipse:

“Quite well. I have excellent night vision. This is a special boat, then?”

## Barcos a vapor (steamboats)

“The Fevre River Packet Company, that’s me,” Marsh went on. “Called it that on account of where I was born, up on the Fevre near Galena, not ’cause I only worked that river, since I didn’t. I had six boats, working mostly the upper Mississippi trade, St. Louis to St. Paul, with some trips up the Fevre and the Illinois and the Missouri. I was doing just fine, adding a new boat or two most every year, thinking of moving into the Ohio trade, or maybe even New Orleans. But last July my _Mary Clarke_ blew a boiler and burned, up near to Dubuque, burned right to the water line with a hundred dead. And this winter—this was a terrible winter. I had four of my boats wintering here at St. Louis. The _Nicholas Perrot,_ the _Dunleith,_ the _Sweet Fevre,_ and my _Elizabeth A.,_ brand new, only four months in service and a sweet boat too, near 300 feet long with 12 big boilers, fast as any steamboat on the river. I was real proud of my lady Liz. She cost me $200,000, but she was worth every penny of it.” The soup arrived. Marsh tasted a spoonful and scowled. “Too hot,” he said. “Well, anyway, St. Louis is a good place to winter. Don’t freeze too bad down here, nor too long. This winter was different, though. Yes, sir. Ice jam. Damn river froze _hard_.” Marsh extended a huge red hand across the table, palm up, and slowly closed his fingers into a fist. “Put an egg in there and you get the idea, York. Ice can crush a steamboat easier than I can crush an egg. When it breaks up it’s even worse, big gorges sliding down the river, smashing up wharfs, levees, boats, most everything. Winter’s end, I’d lost my boats, all four of ’em. The ice took ’em away from me.”

“Insurance?” York asked.

Marsh set to his soup, sucking it up noisily. In between spoons, he shook his head. “I’m not a gambling man, Mister York. I never took no stock in insurance. It’s gambling, all it is, ’cept you’re bettin’ against yourself. What money I made, I put into my boats.”

York nodded. “I believe you still own one steamboat.”

“That I do,” Marsh said. He finished his soup and signaled for the next course. “The _Eli Reynolds,_ a little 150-ton stern-wheeler. I been using her on the Illinois, ’cause she don’t draw much, and she wintered in Peoria, missed the worse of the ice. That’s my asset, sir, that’s what I got left. Trouble is, Mister York, the _Eli Reynolds_ ain’t worth much. She only cost me $25,000 new, and that was back in ’50.”

“Seven years,” York said. “Not a very long time.”

Marsh shook his head. “Seven years is a powerful long time for a steamboat,” he said. “Most of ’em don’t last but four or five. River just eats ’em up. The _Eli Reynolds_ was better built than most, but still, she ain’t got that long left.”

#### Eclipse 

“Hell yes, she’s special. She’s the _Eclipse_. Every goddamned man and boy on this river knows her. Old now—she was built back in ’52, five years ago. But she’s still grand. Cost $375,000, so they say, and worth all of it. There ain’t never been a bigger, fancier, more formid-a-bul boat than this one right here. I’ve studied her, taken passage on her. I know.” Marsh pointed. “She measures 365 feet by 40, and her grand saloon is 330 feet long, and you never seen nothin’ like it. Got a gold statue of Henry Clay at one end, and Andy Jackson at the other, the two of ’em glaring at each other the whole damn way. More crystal and silver and colored glass than the Planters’ House ever dreamed of, oil paintings, food like you ain’t never tasted, and mirrors—_such_ mirrors. And all that’s nothin’ to her speed.

“Down below on the main deck she carries 15 boilers. Got an 11-foot stroke, I tell you, and there ain’t a boat on any river can run with her when Cap’n Sturgeon gets up her steam. She’s done eighteen miles an hour upstream, easy. Back in ’53, she set the record from New Orleans to Louisville. I know her time by heart. Four days, nine hours, thirty minutes, and she beat the goddamned _A. L. Shotwell_ by fifty minutes, fast as the _Shotwell_ is.” Marsh rounded to face York. “I hoped my Lady Liz would take the _Eclipse_ some day, beat her time or race her head to head, but she never could of done it, I know that now. I was just foolin’ myself. I didn’t have the money it takes to build a boat that can take the _Eclipse_.

“You give me that money, Mister York, and you’ve got yourself a partner. There’s your answer, sir. You want half of Fevre River Packets, and a partner who runs things quiet and don’t ask you no questions ’bout your business? Fine. Then you give me the money to build a steamboat like that.”

## Locais

### Hotel Planters’ House

Hotel que aparenta ser um bom estabelecimento, frequentado majoritariamente por barqueiros, amigos e rivais de Marsh segundo ele mesmo. Os preços do local parecem ser relativamente altos. 

Esse é o primeiro local que conhecemos, porque é justamente aqui que Marsh e York se encontram pela primeira vez e começam a sua parceria.
