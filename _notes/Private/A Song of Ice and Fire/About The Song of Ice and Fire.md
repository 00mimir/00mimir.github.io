The Song of Ice and Fire is mentioned the first and only time in the series by Rhaegar when Dany is having her vision the House of the Undying. Afterwards, we just have Dany asking Ser Jorah if he knows the song, which he doesn't, and that's it, we don't have any more mention or references to the Song of Ice and Fire. 

So, I want to talk more about this song that is not talked enough in series, besides being in the title. I was listening to the [Who Knows the Song of Ice and Fire?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyvHh1it1A) live stream by History of Westeros and they brought a lot of good points. So here I will share some of the notes that took while listening the stream. 

## Melisandre Interpretations of Azor Ahai

We know that we can't trust the interpretations that Mel has about visions and prophecies, either because she can't always see as much as she want, but because she wants to believe that Stannis is Azor Ahai and, since she has a lot of sway with the one true king, she has a lot of pressure to deal with, which makes her wants to believe in certain outcomes of the visions. 

Taking all of this into consideration, I want to focus on one aspect of her interpretation of Azor Ahai reborn. She makes some kind of ritual that simbolizes the reborn of Stannis as Azor Ahai, gathering all the prophecy's elements: salt, smoke and under a bleeding star. I want to use this to point out that maybe Azor Ahai doesn't need to born under such conditions, but he/she can be reborn under these symbols. 

I'm on the idea that the whole scene with Wun Wun killing the guy with stars on his house arms, the smoke from Jon's breath and Marsh's tears are the elements that symbolizes Jon as Azor Ahai. 

## Westeros on ice and fire

Maybe by A Dream of Spring (please George), Westeros will be on fire on the south with the second dance of the dragons and it will be on ice with the Others coming from the north.

## A song doesn't need to play just once

I think maybe the Song of Ice and Fire don't need to happen just once, but maybe multiple times and the books that we are reading is one of the times that this song is being played. 

I think maybe Aegon and his sisters were the first. But I need to consider that the ice part was not involved, since we don't have any information of some manifestation of the Others.

## Aegon's dreams

Maybe Aegon saw Dany's dragons, and since they probably have the same coloring, he thought he was the prince that was promised 

## The prince that was promised 

All this prophecy was not written in the common tongue of Westeros, maybe it was written in valyrian and the world doesn't mean exactly prince, but some leader figure of some kind, that was translated as such. I think Maester Aemon says that the world comes from a draconic origin of some sort. Need to investigate. 

## The red comet 

I think that maybe the Others doesn't bring the darkness or night, so they need an external factor to cause the long night, so they can advance. And maybe this explains why it took so much time for them to be so active, because the know that this external factor will happen, and maybe it is a comet. One way to know this is the figure it out if we had such a long summer as the one that was ending by the first book. 

I don't believe that they were completely unactive during 8 thousand years, but maybe know they are gathering as much strength as they can. 

Why they are invading? I don't know yet and have no clue. 

## The Great Other

The Great Other maybe is not an Other at all. It can be a human, a green man or a children of the forest. It can be something like a council for all we know. So I don't think that the leader needs to have blue eyes. I think the blue eyes just indicate that ice magic is being used to reanimate and control the wights.
