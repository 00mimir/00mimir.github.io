<p>Jekyll Garden wouldnâ€™t exist without the contributions of many talented developers and designers. Hereâ€™s who made it possible:</p>

<h2 id="development-and-inspiration">Development and Inspiration</h2>

<p>The foundation of Jekyll Garden comes from the work of several key individuals. <strong><a href="https://github.com/rgvr">Raghuveer</a></strong> created the <a href="https://github.com/rgvr/simply-jekyll">Simply Jekyll theme</a> that served as the foundation for this project, providing the initial structure and design principles. <strong><a href="https://github.com/santhoshtr">Santosh Thottingal</a></strong> introduced the concept of Digital Gardens and inspired the wiki-linking approach that makes Jekyll Garden unique.</p>

<p>The development involved several contributors who brought their expertise to different aspects. <strong><a href="https://github.com/asimkt">Asim K T</a></strong> coded the base HTML structure and implemented the core Jekyll Garden functionality. <strong><a href="https://github.com/ershad">Ershad</a></strong> provided invaluable help with Jekyll and Ruby development. <strong><a href="https://github.com/anishsheela">Anish</a></strong> contributed JavaScript improvements and bug fixes. <strong><a href="https://github.com/aashiks">Puttalu</a></strong> provided OrgMode expertise and guidance.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Team Obsidian</a></strong> deserves special recognition for creating the amazing markdown-based knowledge management tool that inspired the wiki-link syntax we use throughout the theme.</p>
