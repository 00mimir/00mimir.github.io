<p>Jekyll Garden is a clean, minimal Jekyll theme designed to make publishing your Obsidian vault as a static website incredibly easy. It bridges the gap between private knowledge management and public sharing, allowing you to create a digital garden where your notes are interconnected through wiki-style links and easily discoverable through search.</p>
